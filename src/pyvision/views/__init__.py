# ui.py

"""The `ui` module is responsible for rendering tkinter elements.

This module provides functions and classes for creating and managing the user interface
of a tkinter application. It includes functions for creating windows, frames, buttons,
labels, and other UI elements, as well as classes for managing layout and event handling.

Example usage:

    import ui

    # Create a window
    window = ui.Window(title="My App", size=(800, 600))

    # Create a frame
    frame = ui.Frame(parent=window)

    # Create a button
    button = ui.Button(parent=frame, text="Click me", command=handle_click)

    # Start the main event loop
    ui.run()
